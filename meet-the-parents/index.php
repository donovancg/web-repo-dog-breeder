                    <p class="family__description">Zoe is 3/4 Yorkie and a 1/4 poodle. She is my best mama. She absolutely loves puppies. Sometimes, she even tries to take care of puppies from another litter. She has the sweetest personality and loves everyone. Her favorite person in the world is my 15 year old son. On multiple occasions he tries to wake up before me to make sure she is out of his bed and I don’t see her sleeping with him. We truly love her to pieces.</p>

                    <p class="family__description">Poppy is my blue brindle poodle. She has more energy than all my dogs put together. She’s always the first to the door whenever we leave the house, knowing she goes everywhere I go. She loves to meet new people and other dogs. She is very snuggly and loves to be under covers. The whole family loves her.</p>

                    <p class="family__description">Prada is the new addition to our pack. She’s the daughter of Poppy and Doc. She’s my first parti Yorkipoo and hopefully not the last. She’s been such a wonderful puppy to raise. She learns very quickly and loves to work on new commands. She follows me around everywhere, loves car rides and always wants to be in my lap. She is on the smaller size so I will be breeding her to a very small Yorkipoo. I’m very excited to see her puppies in the future.</p>

                    <p class="family__description">Blue is a chocolate Yorkipoo. She is very sweet and loves to play. She is very well mannered and loves to work on commands. If there is ever a time where I can’t find her, she typically is always hanging out with the kids. She loves to run fast and can’t wait to go on a walk.</p>
